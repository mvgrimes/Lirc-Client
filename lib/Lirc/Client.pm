=head1 NAME

Lirc::Client - A client library for the Linux Infrared Remote Control

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lirc::Client;
  ...
  my $lirc = Lirc::Client->new({ prog => 'progname' });
  my $code;
  do {                         # Loop while getting ir codes
    $code = $lirc->next_code;  # wait for a new ir code
    print "Lirc> $code\n";
    process( $code );          # do whatever you want with the code
  } while( defined $code );    # undef will be returned when lirc dev exits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple interface to the Linux Infrared Remote
Control (Lirc). The module encapsulates parsing the Lirc config file (.lircrc),
opening a connection to the Lirc device, and retrieving events from the 
device.

=head1 METHODS


=head2 new( program, \%options )

  my $lirc = Lirc::Client->new( {    
               prog    => 'progname',           # required
               rcfile  => "$ENV{HOME}/.lircrc", # optional
               dev     => "/dev/lircd",         # optional
               debug   => 0,                    # optional
               fake    => 1,                    # optional
        } );

  # Depreciated positional syntax; don't use
  my $lirc = Lirc::Client->new( 'progname',    # required
               "$ENV{HOME}/.lircrc",           # optional
               '/dev/lircd', 0, 0 );           # optional

The constructor accepts two calling forms: an ordered list (for backwards
compatibility), and a hash ref of configuration options. The two forms
can be combined as long as the hash ref is last.

=over 4

=item prog    => 'progname'

Required parameter identifying the program token for Lirc.

=item rcfile  => "$ENV{HOME}/.lircrc"

Path to the C<.lircrc> configuration file. Optional.

=item dev     => "/dev/lircd"

The path to the Lirc device. Optional.

=item debug   => 0

Flag to turn on debugging output. Optional.

=item fake    => 1

Will cause Lirc::Client to read from STDIN rather than the lircd device. 
This is meant to facilitate debugging and testing. Optional.

=back

When called the constructor defines the program token used in the Lirc
config file, opens and parses the Lirc config file (B<rcfile> defaults to
~/.lircrc if none specified), connects to the Lirc device (B<dev> defaults to
/dev/lircd if none specified), and returns the Lirc::Client object.

=head2 recognized_commands()

  my @list = $lirc->recognized_commands;

Returns a list of all the recognized commands for this application (as
defined in C<prog> parameter to the call to B<new>).

=head2 next_code()

=head2 nextcode()

  my $code = $lirc->next_code;

Retrieves the next IR command associated with the B<progname> as defined in
B<new()>, blocking if none is available. B<next_code> uses the stdio read
commands which are buffered. Use B<next_codes> if you are also using select.

=head2 next_codes()

=head2 nextcodes()

  my @codes = $lirc->next_codes;

Retrieves any IR commands associated with the B<progname> as defined in the 
B<new()> constructor, blocking if none are available. B<next_codes> uses
sysread so it is compatible with B<select> driven event loops. This is 
the most efficient method to accomplish a non-blocking read.

Due to the mechanics of B<sysread> and B<select>, this version may
return multiple IR codes so the return value is an array.

Here is an example using IO::Select:

    use IO::Select;
    ....
    my $select = IO::Select->new();
    $select->add( $lirc->sock );
    while(1){
        # do your own stuff, if you want
        if( my @ready = $select->can_read(0) ){ 
            # an ir event has been received (if you are tracking other
            # filehandles, you need to make sure it is lirc)
            my @codes = $lirc->next_codes;    # should not block
            for my $code (@codes){
                process( $code );
            }
        }
    }

This is much more efficient than looping over B<next_code> in non-blocking
mode. See the B<select.t> test for the complete example. Also, checkout the
B<Event> module on CPAN for a nice way to handle your event loops.

=head2 sock()

  my $sock = $lirc->sock;

Returns (or sets if an argument is passed) the socket from which to read
lirc commands. This can be used to work Lirc::Client into you own event 
loop. 

=head2 parse_line()

  my $code = $lirc->parse_line( $line );

Takes a full line as read from the lirc device and returns code on the 
B<config> line of the lircrc file for that button. This can be used in 
combination with B<sock> to take more of the event loop control out of
Lirc::Client.

=head2 clean_up()

  $lirc->clean_up;

Closes the Lirc device pipe, etc. B<clean_up> will be called when the lirc
object goes out of scope, so this is not necessary.

=head2 debug()

  $lirc->debug;

Return the debug status for the lirc object.

=head1 TODO

Features that are outlined in the C<.lircrc> specification which have not yet
been implemented include:

=over 4

=item * The mode should be independent of the prog token

=item * Implement the C<once> flag

=item * Implement the C<quit> flag and executing multiple entries

=item * Support for multiple C<config> entries

=item * Implement the C<delay> token

=item * Supprot non-printable charaters in the C<config> command

=item * Support key sequenses (multiple C<remote>, C<button> entries per block)
    
=item * Support VERSION and LIST commands

=item * Watch for signals from lircd to re-read rc file (C<SIGHUP>)

=item * Add C<SEND_*> support

=back

Features that have been recently implemented include:

=over 4

=item * Support for C<mode>s

=item * Recognizing the C<startup_mode> flag and automatically starting in 
a mode that is identical to the program name

=item * The C<include> directive

=item * Support wild card C<*> entries for C<remote> or C<button>, and blocks
that lack a C<remote>

=back

If anyone has need of one or more of these features, please let me know
(via http://rt.cpan.org if possible).

=head1 THANKS

Parts of this package were inspired by a project by michael@engsoc.org and
Perl LIRC Client (plircc) by Matti Airas (mairas@iki.fi).

=head1 BUGS

There are a few features that a .lircrc file is supposed to support
(according to http://www.lirc.org/html/configure.html#lircrc_format) that 
have not yet been implemented. See TODO for a list.
